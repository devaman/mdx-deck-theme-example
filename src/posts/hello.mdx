This site was generated with Gatsby using
`@jxnblk/gatsby-theme-mdx-blog`
& `@mdx-deck/gatsby-theme`.

In the [Decks](/decks) page you'll see a list of MDX Decks.
And the [Blog](/blog) index page is this blog.

The homepage uses the layout components from the blog theme to create a custom layout, but otherwise styles are isolated from each theme.

So yeah, Gatsby themes are pretty rad.
