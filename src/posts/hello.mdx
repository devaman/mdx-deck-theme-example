This site was generated with Gatsby using
`@jxnblk/gatsby-theme-mdx-blog`
& `@mdx-deck/gatsby-theme`.

In the [Decks](/decks) page you'll see a list of MDX Decks.
And the [Blog](/blog) index page is this blog.

The homepage uses the layout components from the blog theme to create a custom layout, but otherwise styles are isolated from each theme.

So yeah, Gatsby themes are pretty rad.

## Write-ups

Say you've finished your presentation, but want to share it with the world as a write-up on your blog.
Using the MDX Deck theme in your Gatsby site means the source MDX file is already in your project,
and you can use the MDX Deck `<Embed />` component to place individual slides in your blog's MDX file, like the one below.

<Embed src={GettingStarted} slide={5} />
