# Hello, Deck

---

This deck is rendered using `@mdx-deck/gatsby-theme`

---

Each `.mdx` file in the `src/decks/` directory will generate a new MDX Deck as a route in your Gatsby site.

---

This means you can add your decks to any Gatsby site

---

And include things like a [Blog](/blog) in the same project.

---

Pretty cool stuff :sunglasses:
